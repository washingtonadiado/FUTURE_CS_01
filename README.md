# Web Application Security Testing Report

## Overview

This report documents the security assessment of a sample web application, focusing on vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws. The testing was conducted using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and SQLMap.

## Tools Used

- **OWASP ZAP** – Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Burp Suite** – Intercepting and analyzing requests
- **SQLMap** – SQL Injection testing

## Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance & Information Gathering** – Identified exposed services and system details.
2. **Automated Scanning** – Used OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite to detect vulnerabilities.
3. **Manual Exploitation** – Validated and exploited potential weaknesses.
4. **Risk Assessment** – Evaluated the impact and likelihood of vulnerabilities.
5. **Remediation Recommendations** – Provided solutions to mitigate risks.

## Key Findings

### OWASP ZAP Scan Results

- **SQL Injection (High Risk)** – Found injectable parameters in login and search fields.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Risk)** – Identified reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Security Misconfigurations (Medium Risk)** – Missing HTTP security headers.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (Medium Risk)** – Unauthorized data access via modified URLs.

### Burp Suite Analysis

- **Session Hijacking** – Weak session management detected.
- **Broken Authentication** – Lack of account lockout mechanisms.
- **Unvalidated Redirects** – Open redirects susceptible to phishing attacks.

### SQLMap Testing

- **Successful SQL Injection Exploits** – Verified database access vulnerabilities.

## Risk Assessment & Impact

| Risk                           | Impact                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL Injection**              | Attackers can manipulate database queries, steal data, or gain system access. |
| **XSS**                        | Can lead to credential theft and session hijacking.                           |
| **Security Misconfigurations** | Increases exposure to unauthorized access.                                    |
| **Broken Authentication**      | Higher chances of account takeovers.                                          |

## Remediation Recommendations

### Application-Level Fixes

- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection.
- Implement input validation and output encoding to mitigate XSS.
- Strengthen session security with HTTPOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags.
- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and account lockout mechanisms.

### Network & Server Security

- Restrict database access using firewall rules and VPN.
- Disable unused ports and services to reduce the attack surface.
- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

### Security Best Practices

- Conduct regular penetration testing.
- Set up continuous monitoring and logging.
- Train developers on secure coding practices.

## Conclusion

This security assessment identified critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Implementing secure coding practices, robust authentication mechanisms, and continuous security monitoring will significantly mitigate risks.

## Next Steps

✅ Immediate remediation of high-risk vulnerabilities.\
✅ Continuous monitoring with security tools.\
✅ Security awareness training for developers.
